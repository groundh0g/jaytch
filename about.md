The work you see before you was predicted by the ancient texts.

    Gen  1:1  In the beginning, @AlGoreRythm created the 'net and the web. 2 Now the web was formless 
              and filled with dancing hamsters, videos of cats, and images of scantily-clad women.
    Gen  1:6  And @torvalds said, "Let there be a vault between the code to separate commit from commit."
              7 And it was so. 8 @torvalds called the vault “git.” And there was evening, and there was 
              morning—the 0x02nd day.
    Gen  2:18 Then @mojombo said, "It is not good that programmer code alone. I will make a git 'hub'
              where developers may collaborate!", and there was a repository. 19 @mojombo saw that the
              repo was good.
    Gen  2:25 The developers were naked, and they had no shame.
    Gen 11:8  There were a multitude of content management systems. Each driven by data. 9 Within these words 
              pressed, only confusion stood. That is why it was called babel.
    Exo 34:27 Then @mojombo said to Ruby, "Write down these words."
    Act  2:4  All of them were filled with the markdown and began to write in other tongues, as the keyboard
              enabled them.
    Act  2:13 Some, however, made fun of them and said, "They have had too much wine."
    Rev 17:4  @mdo and @fat dressed the text in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious
              stones, and pearls.
    Neh 12:28 The templates and static text also were brought together from the region around getbootstrap 
              and jekyllrb by @plusjade.
    Isa 25:12 It was prophesied that those high fortified walls would be brought down to be laid low; 
              he will bring them down to the @groundh0g, to the very dust.

It is here that our new chapter begins! Now, the power of Jekyll, Bootstrap, and Github Pages has been handed to mere mortals.

This is the '{{ site.jaytch.layout.framework }}' framework, using the '{{ site.jaytch.layout.theme }}' theme. You can find out more info about how Jaytch handles themes and such in [the documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/layouts-frameworks-themes-and-templates).
