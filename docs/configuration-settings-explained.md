title: Configuration Settings Explained
---

This is a breakdown of the available settings for Jaytch.

### The **_config.yml** File

All relevant settings are in the `_config.yml` file, under the `jaytch:` section.

~~~
# Jaytch settings
jaytch:
  version : 0.1.0
~~~

The general settings include things like the site's title, tagline, and description.

~~~
  title: Jaytch!             # Your blog or site title.
  tagline: The Jekyll Helper # Your blog or site tagline.
  description: > # An awesome description of your blog or site.
    A rewite of JekyllBootstrap (plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap) that
    is built from the ground up to support Jekyll 3.x and Bootstrap 3.x,
    while targeting the dependencies of GitHub Pages.
~~~

### 404 File Not Found

Jaytch provides several ready-made 404 pages. Their usage is detailed in [Specifying a 404 Page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/specifying-a-404-page).

~~~
  page_404: sticky # badge | dog | droids | glass | link | milk | monster | potty | shrug | sticky | tweet | zork
  tweetHash:     "jaytch #blogs #OSS" # don't hash first tag
  tweetShoutOut: "GetJaytch"
~~~

### Searching Posts

Jaytch provides a JavaScript-based search function today. In the future, support may be added to include embedded search services such as Google, Bing, and others.

In general settings in this section accept one of three types of values.

* **true** - always search this field
* **false** - never search this field
* **{number}** - only include this field when there are fewer than {number+1} posts

~~~
  search: # valid values are: true | false | {number}
    title:     true # always search
    tags:      true # always search
    keywords:  true # always search
    excerpt:   2000 # only search when fewer than 2001 posts
    inclPages: true # valid values are: true | false
~~~

### Layout Structure

Jaytch separates the layout into three components:

* Framework - the underlying JavaScript and CSS (ex: Bootstrap)
* Theme - the overridden styles that vary the look and feel of the site
* Template - the basic structure of the site

For more details about this construct, see [Frameworks, Themes, and Templates]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/layouts-frameworks-themes-and-templates).

~~~
  layout:
    minified: true          # Use *.min.css and *.min.js, when available.
    usecdn: false           # Use CDN (content delivery network), when supported.
    customcss: custom.css   # loaded after theme css files
    customjs:  custom.js    # loaded after theme js files
    framework: bootstrap-v3 # default | bootstrap-v3

### Contributors and Author Bios

Jaytch supports associating posts to authors. Authors are described in the `_config.yml` file, and that data is used to populate the Contributors page. See [Using Author Bios]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/using-author-bios) for more details.
